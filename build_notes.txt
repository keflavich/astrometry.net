Adam's build notes, November 21 2014:

I had to use this SO post:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10327939/erroring-on-no-such-instruction-while-assembling-project-on-mac-os-x-lion
and in each individual subdirectory run
CFLAGS='-Wa,-q' make -j 8
in order to get things to build.  I couldn't run it in the parent directory
